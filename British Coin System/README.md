# 💷 **British Currency Converter — Pounds, Shillings & Pence**

This C++ program converts **pre-decimal British currency** (pounds, shillings, and pence) into **modern decimal pounds (£)**.  
It’s a simple yet educational program demonstrating **basic arithmetic, constants, and formatted output** in C++.

## 🧠 **Concept Overview**

Before 1971, the UK used a **non-decimal currency system**, where:

| **Unit** | **Conversion** |
|-----------|----------------|
| 1 pound (£1) | = 20 shillings |
| 1 shilling | = 12 pence |
| 👉 Therefore, 1 pound | = 240 pence |

This program accepts user input for **pounds, shillings, and pence**, then converts it into **decimal pounds** using these relationships.
