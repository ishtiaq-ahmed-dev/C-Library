## 🚀 **About This Repository**

This repository is designed for:
- 🧩 Practicing **C++ fundamentals**  
- 🧠 Solving **real-life logical problems**  
- 🏗️ Implementing **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)**  
- 💾 Exploring **file handling, pointers, and OOP concepts**  

Each program is **self-contained**, well-commented, and tested to ensure clarity and correctness.
